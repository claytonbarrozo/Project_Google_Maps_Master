# Five-Awesome-Latin-American-Restaurants-in-Dublin, Ireland
My 5th project for the Udacity FEND program. In this project I use Google Maps API, Foursquare API, and knockout.js to create a web app that displays 4 Awesome Brazilian Restaurants and 1 Argentina in Dublin, Ireland.

## Installation
To install and run this web application, simply download the repository as a zipfile and extract.
After extracting the zipfile, open the index.html file in your web browser. You can click on the
marker icons on the map for the five locations loaded on default to view more information about them.
You can also use the search bar to type in any of the names of the locations shown on the map and
to filter out the other locations that do not meet the search criteria.

The live site can also be visited here: https://claytonbarrozo.github.io/Project_Google_Maps_Master/
